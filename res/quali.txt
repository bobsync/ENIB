1. Would you dine with a virtual character again? Why or why not?

--- GRUPPO: PERSONALIZZATO (N=16) ---
  [01] I'd say yes, and it doesn't bother me, uh, I don't think that I don't think that uh it is like an amazing experience, but uh. Uh. But yeah, I, I would probably do it again. And why? Because, um. I, I don't think that's that it is like uh an amazing experience because. The, the virtual the virtual, the virtual character. Doesn't really understand well what I say. And sometimes, uh. Ask me something, something strange. Um, so. That's it.
  [02] It was a funny experience to try and I think that I would like to repeat that again, but mm I don't know if I would like to do that often because mm I, I think that I like to. Um, interact with people, with real people and not with. Uh, an amateur, but it was funny. Mm yeah.
  [03] Yes, I would dine with a virtual character again because it was nothing embarrassing or stressful. So it is an experience I would do again. I don't know if I would choose to do that again, like I don't know if I want to, but if I happen to. Having the possibility or I have to do it, it's no big deal, basically. So that's why. that
  [04] I think I would definitely chat with the virtual character again. Uh, it was a bit weird, perhaps I wasn't really prepared. So. I think I would like another chance, I think. I know what to expect now and that could be. Interesting for me to do again. I think that's perhaps a common sentiment.
  [05] Um, yes, I would love to, to dine with a future character again, um, but, uh, also, um, I would love to have, um, a future, um, AI that could, uh, you know, actually express its opinions without being, uh, you know, um. Uh, subject to, to the, the code, he has, I think it's really, really, really impossible, but, uh, you know, in the future if it, if it happens, it would be really nice actually, um, and also a character that could, uh, express, uh, itself without, uh, you know, repeating what I, what I said and asking me questions, saying I don't know, uh, uh, what, what is a different thing you like, what is a different thing you love, something like that, you know.
  [06] I think this is a very important thing, especially because I will do it again, and I think this is a great chance for those who live alone, especially elderly people, because sometimes they don't have anyone to talk to and having um an IE to be able to speak to them, especially when they're eating, can be a great experience for them also because they have someone to talk to, and that's it. OK. This is.
  [07] Um, I, I don't know because, uh, maybe it could, it could be a good thing for the people that really, really alone. Maybe right now my my answer could be. Um, I don't know, influence, uh, influenced by my actual situation, but, but maybe in the future, it can be. Uh, a good thing, uh, especially for people that it's really alone, that they suffer their loneliness. And uh maybe if I. Will be. Uh, alone and suffering my loneliness, maybe it could, uh, it could be a good thing to use it and uh. Maybe. I don't know. Um, yes, it could be a, a good thing.
  [08] Or a, OK. Um, I will do it again. I, I, I think I will do. Uh, I just had, uh, um, a little issue about the, the latency between the, the answer and the response from the author. But apart this uh this particular, uh, I think it's the right thing to do. And, and to have some company when you, you are eating or do you, or you have to meet, have a meal alone.
  [09] Yes, I would dine with a. Virtual character again, because uh it was interesting. And uh. The conversation was quite smooth. So it was a nice experience. And I did the Avatar mm found some interesting topics to talk about, so it was good.
  [10] Yes, I will do it again because it was really fun and interesting. Even sometimes she didn't understand what I was saying, but it was fun. Because she was really. Uh, the fact that she was doing a lot of questions, it was, it made everything easier, so yes, I will do it again, and I think it was, uh, fun.
  [11] Uh, yes, I would dine again with um virtual character, uh, basically because, uh, uh, this experience was, uh, was very good. Uh, the, the virtual character also, uh, found some interesting common, so we, we talked about them, uh, like movies, uh, and TV series. And, um, um, the main reason, um. For which I would not die again is because in some moments there is an awkward silence which that makes me makes me a little awkward. Um, another interesting, uh, thing is that, um, uh, I like the fact that if you don't have an argument to talk about, it will come up with something, and, uh, in my experience, uh, it, uh, it came up with, uh, with something interesting, so, uh, made the conversation more, uh, um, it made it easier.
  [12] I will um hm again. Um, because it was very interesting. And uh a novelty. Uh, maybe. For the future. Uh, it will be. It's a good thing. Mm So, It was a good experience.
  [13] I would dine with virtual charter again. Because I, I'm very excited to. Um Improve my English with um um [PII]. It's a great experience. Who he finish.
  [14] OK, so, um, I don't think so. It was a nice experience. But it was also a bit unsettling, so I don't know if it's because it's still in developing, so. It's not quite ready yet, but. Um. I don't know, it felt a bit. Mechanical, not so smooth as a normal human interaction, so I don't think so, actually.
  [15] I Uh, yes, I would dine again with a virtual character. It was surely an interesting experience, uh, different from, uh, everything I've ever done. Uh, probably I would not use it every day since mainly because I usually have someone to dine with and also because, uh, it's maybe a little bit, uh, I don't know, depressing on the long run. Um, but for someone who is alone or who is away from his family, from their family or their friends, for example, uh, especially if someone may be old, uh, it can be a very useful tool.
  [16] No, I wouldn't die with a virtual character again, not because I didn't enjoy it, but because I think that um eating with um real people, real human beings is better, cuz you can exchange like uh thoughts, ideas, and um, there's more like, there's more, there are more feelings, um, you know, so yeah.

--- GRUPPO: STATICO (N=15) ---
  [01] Yes, I would like to dine with a virtual character again. It was very interesting and simulating. And uh it was uh nice to have someone to chat with while eating my meal. And the question, this uh uh virtual character act was very interesting and um It was a a nice dining experience.
  [02] Yeah, I would dine with another virtual character again because it was a fun experience. And it can keep you company when you're not um. You're alone, maybe. But then, that's not something I would do every day when I'm alone. And also I think um. Uh, some things can be um. Do better, like, for example, the answers and the reaction of the virtual character.
  [03] Yes, I would like to dine with a virtual character again because, uh, it would be an interesting conversation and you can discover, uh, new things, and it, uh, um, it's like eating with someone else. Um
  [04] Um, I would not, uh, dine again with a virtual child character because um. It was very slow and uh the main um problem is that um she cannot uh give up person personalized um. Answers, um, uh, to my questions so, uh, it's all about, uh, me and uh what I want to say to her, but, uh, she can't, uh, give a proper feedback, uh, a proper, um, mm answer about, um, how she feels because, uh, she doesn't feel, um. So this is in the. Main, uh, uh, the main thing that's uh bores, uh, bores me, uh, a little.
  [05] Mm mm yes, I will probably would dine again with uh some visual character uh. Or some sort of avatar because it has been an interesting experience. It was nice. Uh, I mean this conversation and. I will try it. I, I mean, I would be interested in doing it again, but if the occasion will. Would uh would appear, so. Maybe that happens again, I will. Enjoy doing it, doing it again. Uh, it's been a nice experience, so. I don't have anything negative to say. Maybe just the thing that sometimes the elder didn't understand what what I was saying. It was nice.
  [06] Yeah, uh, I will, uh, Uh, then again with a virtual character. A character. Um, but, uh. Maybe when they are a little bit more responsive. So like it doesn't take. 20 seconds to answer that question. So basically Is this.
  [07] Um, I'm not sure I would like to eat again with a virtual character. I still, still prefer if I want some company to eat with a human being since the interaction is more, uh, still feel more, feels more real. But, uh, if you don't have any other option, it may be a good option, uh, to eat with a virtual character. Uh, just some company and just opening your mouth, mouth and expressing your feelings can be. Um, something positive, uh, so, mm, for me it's a no, but just because I'm in a situation, uh, for which I don't feel I need it.
  [08] I Uh, I, I do it again because uh it is, uh, really interesting. And uh I. Uh, it keeps you company when you're alone and, uh, I do it again even if I prefer to speak with someone, uh, real, but, uh, for people alone it would be very useful.
  [09] Barlo Barlolosaa. I'm OK. Did you know that? Yes, I would dine with a virtual character again. Uh, I think it does mean, uh. Kind of experience. It has been really. Nice and warm and the chatter has been going on quite flowing.
  [10] Yeah, I'm, I will probably. I'm but I will crush Arro again. It's because. I just feel like was not and I can talk about something that can really know more things about me, of this for what I could do. OK good. So, yeah, well, maybe now with the shot again.
  [11] Yeah, I will do again. Why not? I think that it's something new for me. Never trying something like that. Um, I think that that it can give you another chance to a beautiful character.
  [12] Yes, I would dine again with a virtual character. It was uh an interesting experience and basically I don't like to, to, to eat alone, so I think it could be um a good alternative than eating alone and um. The. Yes, it's, it's, it was something to do while eating so you can uh talk to someone else and talk about everything and it could be interesting to do it again.
  [13] OK I think uh speaking with a real person is more interesting than speaking with a. A virtual character, uh, maybe I would dine again, but I prefer honestly talking with a real person because uh it gives you more opportunity to know a tangible person. Uh
  [14] Yes, I would dine again with a virtual character. It was an interesting experience. I liked, uh, how the character was able to go along with my conversation, although, of course, there are some things that could be, uh, enhanced or made better for the character. For example, I believe that maybe I talked too much or used long sentences, so the character would somewhat get lost into what I was saying, or maybe I was changing the argument too fast and the character would not follow immediately along because it was answering my previous question.
  [15] Okay now is recording Yes I like to have lunch with an Avatar because it's better than my simply computer monitor very often when I am at work I read news on my computer so without virtual character and so. It is worse, it's better to have someone with human shape than simply monitor of a computer. So the answer is yes um I. Hai hai. Mhm I like to to speak to um an avatar while having lunch.

2. In what contexts could a virtual dining companion be useful?

--- GRUPPO: PERSONALIZZATO (N=16) ---
  [01] Um, I'm thinking like in hospitals where people have to. To stay alone for a long period of time. And uh so the, the, the com the dining companion, the virtual dining companion could be useful, uh, maybe if they are like in quarantine or something like that. Uh, I don't know. I. Uh, I can think of, uh, another context, context.
  [02] I think that um this experience would be useful for people that don't have uh friends or parents uh for eating and probably. For people that need some company, um, or have some problems, uh, or eating disorder or some problem of that kind.
  [03] I think it would be useful for people who feel alone and lonely. Um, I wouldn't necessarily use it myself, cuz I'm OK with eating alone, but. I can see how it can be helpful for those who aren't OK with it. Cause surely. It feels the. The lonely times where you have no one to talk to, and I know a few people who need someone to eat with, um, they usually like call people and stuff, and that could be an alternative.
  [04] I think it would be interesting to try it perhaps with. Um, old people suffering from loneliness or. Um, I was wondering if it could be useful for some types of mental illnesses. But I don't really. I don't really know about that. I'm not, I'm not informed. Uh, but maybe it could work.
  [05] So I believe that some people could actually find it really useful because in some cases unfortunately society isn't, you know, uh, soundproof because, um, these people have, I don't know, they, they feel left out, they are alone, lonely, what uh whatever and uh. They, they could actually find it useful to have, uh, to have someone to talk to, you know, during their meals and, uh, well, actually during also their, their everyday life, but in this case, uh, yeah, during, um, during, uh, the. During the meals, maybe it's um it's a common practice that could be implemented in in in the everyday life of these people, you know, but um with um. It's, uh, it's measures, you know. I think also society should have to play a role in it like it has to. Uh, avoid, um. Um, leaving this these people out of, uh, of, of, of the of society itself. So, um, I think it could be useful, but it also could be negative. So yeah, let's see about it. Let's see about that.
  [06] I think that this virtual dining companion can be used in different kinds of locations, especially in homes. For example, like, as I said before, for elderly people and people who are used to be alone, home alone all the time, but at the same time, also in hospitals and in hospices, so in places where people tend to be very lonely. And it can be a great companion also when going outside. So when staying, for example, in some public lots and enjoying your time outside and have someone to talk to. So I think it's a great, a great companion.
  [07] I think that uh it could be um it could be useful, uh, when, uh, the people is suffering, uh, about loneliness and, uh, um, maybe I don't know people that, uh, uh, go abroad in another country, mm doesn't know anybody or maybe. Don't go out to dinner or during dinner or lunch because they don't feel really comfortable, uh, about the food, uh, that is um. In that country and maybe it can be useful um for that type of people. Uh, that Um, really don't like maybe to go, uh, outside or maybe. I don't know, they, they like to stay alone. But, uh, alone, uh, uh, from a human being, maybe with the virtual avatar, uh, they could have some company and um Try to treat their loneliness. Maybe it could be useful.
  [08] Uh, uh, the best context would be when you, you have to, to have a meal alone and, uh, want to, to talk with someone, um, especially in cases, uh, where you have been alone, for example, for the, for the whole day. And um you need some kind of a um. Human response response um with that uh that can be, can be funny to have.
  [09] I think dining with a virtual companion. It's helpful when you're feeling lonely or a bit stressed and you need to talk with someone. And uh. It's. A good way to calm yourself down. And elaborate on things that are Uh, stressing you or worrying you. So it's a nice way to feel good about yourself and uh relax.
  [10] I think it would be useful for people who lives alone, older people. I live alone, I will use it. And, um, because it keeps you company, so when you're alone, when you're, yeah, for, uh, who doesn't have a family, who it's uh often at home alone, it will be useful. And um.
  [11] The context in which I think the virtual dining companion would be useful is uh basically when you, when you eat alone. So instead of staying on phone or tablet, uh, scrolling uh videos like this, um, it, it can be useful to have a conversation and so if you don't have someone, you could, uh, speak with the virtual companion. Uh, in fact, uh, it was um. A good, uh, company, uh, because it tries to find the, um, uh interesting arguments to talk about. So, uh, you instead of like I was saying, scrolling, you have, um, a conversation with um someone which is virtual but uh it gives you the feeling of uh of someone because it um. It also stimulates you to answer his questions and. And also made me um interested in what in um his answer.
  [12] uh Voor me um. Beetle dining will be useful for the lonely persons um Zo die uh um um. Nalon. En uh maybe voor. um En Roy en Hav uh with friends um in a different way.
  [13] I think dining uh with a virtual companion would be useful when, um, uh, um, a person is very, very, uh, afraid or, or sad. I think, um, The conversation with uh Audrey can uh very Useful and can Um Can be a, a beautiful experience.
  [14] So I think it would be useful in those context where there's no chance at all to have a real human interaction, so it's rather than nothing I guess. So like, I don't know people in a long term illness facility. Or um. Maybe old people, they are really alone. That's, that's my my answer.
  [15] As I was saying before, uh, dining companion would be useful, especially for people who are, um, maybe alone for work, uh, reasons or maybe just far away from family or friends, um, that can enjoy maybe having to, having someone to talk to. Um, or also maybe for old people, even if the use of technology can be a little, a little difficult for them, but once they understand it, it can be for sure a really useful tool because they can feel less alone and they have someone to share their experiences with.
  [16] I think it would be useful in the study field, like in the research field, because, um, for example, if you have to study um the human behavior while eating, um, it's useful if you have a virtual character um doing that. But uh I don't think it's uh useful in the in an everyday um context, because I think it would discourage um human relations and discourage looking for um human relations when maybe you are alone.

--- GRUPPO: STATICO (N=15) ---
  [01] I think uh um it would be very useful, you know, visual dining companion uh when uh there is someone who is home alone a lot, maybe elderly, elderly, uh, or the person that maybe need company. And, um, or, you know, uh, even young people who live alone and dying alone most of the time, it would be, you know, a very good companion.
  [02] This is a very interesting project because and also it was a very interesting experiment because um a virtual dining companion can be useful, for example, to old people that live alone and they don't have um. Um, maybe family or friends every day at home, and they usually eat alone, especially in the Italian uh culture and uh in our way of thinking, the meals and lunch, dinners, it's very important to spend those moments with some someone. And I think this ritual companion can be um. Um Uh, source of uh. Um, changing and uh uh trying to uh keep uh someone uh company and also to make them less alone and um Yeah, also, sometimes it's just a matter of uh. Um, talk or um. Yeah, uh, some like very few moments for lonely people to have a better day.
  [03] I think, uh, virtual dining companion would be useful, uh, maybe for, uh, older people who live alone, uh, or maybe in some kind of, uh, work environment, uh, where you have, um, a limited time for, uh, lunch and you want to have a chat, but maybe there's no one to chat with in that moment.
  [04] I think it can be useful in um places where there's no other people uh when uh missing miss peoples um for some reason for some reason um and uh actually uh you have to stay alone for a long, long period, um. Uh, I think it's better than nothing, uh, it's um. It's uh it's helpful to you can um at least communicate what you feel and um um take um a little feedback and also can be useful mm. I think to to help people that uh are um away far from society uh for some reason uh depression I don't know to reenter gradually but if uh this there is a service that uh can make the same thing with. Person, uh, with people, uh, always, uh, always, uh, communicate and, uh, the empathy that, uh, someone, uh, can give you is, uh, much better than, uh, uh, than an avatar, uh, but, uh, there is no, if not, uh, there's not this opportunity, mm. This solution can help.
  [05] Uh, probably it would be useful, uh, when you're feeling alone if you want to. Maybe chat with someone having the conversation or. If you just want to Talk about your stuff with someone and you don't have anyone to do it in at that specific moment, so. With a virtual companion, you should be able to. Resolve that uh absence of people to to speak with.
  [06] Um, I think that. Uh, one of the best way to use uh. Uh, companion, a virtual companion. It's maybe like, uh, the companion also have some, uh, some tools and the utilities that help you to eat. To put your drink. And maybe like this, I think. Also, uh, it's, uh, I don't think that a companion in a, in a, a virtual companion, it's useful. In like a companion that uh you have it near, near to you every second. So I, I don't think it's very useful for like entertainment. Or a company. But uh for uh helping you. And uh make you understand more what are you doing. Also in kitchen, it's, it's a good. But
  [07] I think in general, expressing how you feel or talking is always useful. I'm a person that talks a lot alone, so maybe I don't feel the need to do it with even a a virtual assistant, let's say, but um if you're a person that tends to stay quieter and don't talk, uh, and if you live maybe alone or because of your routine, you tend to stay quieter, it, it can be useful, that's, that's the situation I think it's a. It's actually can be very useful.
  [08] um I think it will be useful for people alone, um maybe elder people or. E di someone who doesn't Family or. Situations like this and. Or in general for a person who is alone, momenta- momen-, come dice momentaneamente who is alone at the moment and it needs someone to speak to, while eating.
  [09] I think it would be useful in. A context where there's uh someone alone, maybe. Uh, another man or a woman. Or Maybe for people who for some reason. Can't get. Out from their bed or sofa, so if someone has a broken leg. And for whatever reason he's home alone. Having the companion of a virtual character, I think it could be really useful.
  [10] People say maybe when you're feeling bored and you want to talk about something. Or maybe even when you're sad or things like that. Mostly, I would say like when you're bored. Because when you don't know what to do, you want to maybe talk to someone today and you have no one to talk to. Maybe somebody's on vacation, somebody's doing anything else, you go talk to a doctor. You could listen to you.
  [11] I think it can be useful for people who spend some days in a hospital or in a place where they are alone. They don't have any chance to talk with somebody else. um, so I think that can be a Practice or in any case um be funny if you can talk with someone, OK? So don't be feeling alone.
  [12] It could be uh useful when someone is alone, when someone has problems to eat alone or just doesn't want to, um, I don't like to eat alone, so if I had someone to talk to, even if a virtual companion, I would do it and to people who doesn't like to to felt alone, so I think it could be useful in many situations and. I could use it more uh again and again too.
  [13] I think speaking with a virtual character could be useful for lone persons, uh, lone people or people with who, who have some cognitive, uh, problems or people who have very specific topics to talk about and don't find someone to to talk about these things. It's not doable. Calling
  [14] I think it could be very useful in an educational context. For example, if you were to try to learn a new language, of course, it would be nice being able to practice the language while talking to a character and maybe even when you're a very busy person, you could, uh, be practicing the language while you're eating, or it could be useful if for several reasons, you don't have a chance to generally eat with other people. So, you have the opportunity to eat with someone.
  [15] OK, I think that an avatar is useful for people who, uh, lives alone, uh. And uh because it's um speaking to someone while eating, uh, it makes the dinner or uh or lunch um enjoyable, so. That's, that's, that's good.

What capabilities should an ideal virtual dining companion have?

--- GRUPPO: PERSONALIZZATO (N=16) ---
  [01] Well, I think this should be probably a little bit faster. But, uh, understanding and answering the questions. Um. Faster, faster, faster, faster.
  [02] He, it has to make you feel at ease and understand and probably it, it has to understand when it's time of make a lot of questions or when or it's better to tell something, tell a story, and probably when the the person is eating, he has to. To talk a lot instead of asking, ask, ask some questions. And yeah, it has to make you feel comfortable.
  [03] I think you should try to be empathetic and warm, because talking to an avatar or like a virtual companion could be a little weird at first. So if the person that is talking to it could feel a sense of understanding. I think it would be best.
  [04] Um, Capabilities wise, I think it, uh, should have conversational capabilities. Um. Reactiveness and uh ability to expand on a topic, on a given topic, um, basically be of some company, um, conversation wise.
  [05] Um, well, the capabilities that, um, an AI that would dine with me should have, it's, uh, are, uh, I don't know, um, yeah, expressing their ideas, their thoughts without being, uh, as I said before, controlled by its code always, uh, I have to, um. I have to add, of course, it's, I think it's kind of impossible, but you know, in, in the, in the future, but also, you know, um, he, it has to have a range of, um. Um, of expression from, uh, movies and books, so I don't know, kind of stupid stuff to, um. Uh, politics, ideas and, uh, visuals, and also I believe, uh, I don't know the, the, um. Uh, existential, uh, questions, I think that could be also, uh, useful to talk to, uh, to an AI to have its opinion, you know, um, yeah, that's it. But it's a huge range, but that's it.
  [06] I believe a virtual dining companion should be able to. Talk about different kinds of uh topics and be able to talk about different kinds of situations that are currently happening in the world, and at the same time, understanding the other person's paths or point of view and trying to make sure that they feel comfort and they're able to talk freely to them whenever they want to and whatever they are.
  [07] I think that the capabilities uh really could be enormous because uh. No, during the last 5 to 7 years, uh, there was, um, Uh, you change, um, in the relationship between uh. With people and even uh with the um the virtual avatar and the, the, the computer, smartphone and uh whatsoever. And I think that uh um the capabilities will be huge because there is. Many people that cannot afford to have, um. Um, Something with the other people, talk with other people can be really tough for that, so it really can be useful to Uh, have a virtual avatar to talk with, uh, and to have a lunch, have a dinner. Or maybe drink a cup of coffee and uh it could be useful but uh um we have to be aware that uh uh some um phenomenon like uh ikikomori or something like that. Uh It could be worse in that case, so um. We have to. Control this type of interaction with the virtual realities.
  [08] For sure, the, the best thing, uh, has to be that you have, um, has to have the many informations about everything you are talking about. For example, about movies you, you like or something like that and um the capacity to have uh some sort of memory of the, of the older conversation, conversations you had with him.
  [09] I think an ideal virtual dining companion should be able to. Talk about everything. And be. Um. Empathetic with the. The person He's talking to. Uh, so it should understand. When Our topic is uh. A good way to follow or when it should stop there.
  [10] It should be listen and uh do a lot of questions because sometimes I felt like I didn't have anything more to say and I wanted it to ask me something else and uh being able to talk about different things from obvious to more serious stuff and uh. Mm. That's it, maybe. I'll just listen and asking questions, being friendly.
  [11] So I uh think um he should be able to answer uh promptly so you don't have to wait for, for its answer and also it should uh be able to um come up with the arguments to talk about, uh, in order to avoid um awkward silences uh which could uh make you don't want to talk it anymore. Uh, also, I think, um, uh, it should be able to, to make more questions about yourself, uh, in order to, to make you feel like, uh, it is really interested, uh, interested in, uh, what you're saying. Uh, another thing maybe it should be, uh, able to, to have, um, a lot of arguments to talk about. So if we are talking about something I don't like, I can, uh, easily change it and find, uh, uh, interesting answers from the virtual companion.
  [12] Oh. en dan komen de dingen uh um. Die uh Full de B. Oei, wat is. um Ja. Aan mijn en uh. Voor me uh is in different. Mhm.
  [13] An idle virtual dining companion should have the capability of speaking in English. Um In every language and to speak very slowly. Because there are people that mm. Don't speak English very well.
  [14] So I think the most important thing would be to Be able to process the information. Quickly to provide an answer. As quickly as possible and Mm. Be consistent, so. Yeah, so I think that the most important thing is the, like the conversational aspect of it. Not to be interrupted or to have to overexplain yourself or to wait a lot of time before getting an answer back.
  [15] For sure, it should be, have the, should, should have the ability to um understand what the other person is saying, to reply in an appropriate manner. Um, it should have the ability to uh continue the conversation even if the, the person stops talking. Um, so maybe ask questions and uh uh. I don't know, just, uh, be interested, uh, in what the, the person is saying.
  [16] Um, it would be nice if it had a research uh engine, so that if you come up with a question, you can ask the question to the um virtual um character and it would be uh capable of giving um an answer uh based on what he can find on the Internet, for example, and also maybe. Have like, um, more humanlike uh responses like um, sentences more similar to what a human talks like.

--- GRUPPO: STATICO (N=15) ---
  [01] And capabilities that a virtual learning companion should have, I think, are the ability to understand your answer and to provide um interesting questions that actually follow what you said and, uh, you know, the um. Uh, the responses the companion has, uh, should be joyful and uh transmit to, uh, the, the willing to talk more.
  [02] Uh, for me in this, uh, small talk that I had with the virtual, um, dining companion, the difficulties were that, uh, sometimes, uh, she didn't understood what I was saying and sometimes her answers were very short. And maybe to. Um, Yeah, sure, uh, she would only say thank you or she would only agree with me. I think for um Uh, better, uh. Um, Experience it, uh, something that should be. Updated, uh, it's the way of the answer answers and um. Yeah, maybe to give them. A a little bit more uh of knowledge and uh to. Uh, also adapted to the person she's talking to. So maybe if a person has um some specific interest, she would be more, uh, And I don't know. To know more about that interest or yeah.
  [03] I think, uh, uh, virtual, uh, an ideal virtual dining companion should have uh. Conversation skills and social skills and uh a lot of, uh, topics to talk about, uh, while you are eating. Um. Yes, that's it.
  [04] Uh, has to be more fluent, um. Um, and, uh, understand better what uh what we say. And have to know. Mm The the main topics, the main things that, um, um, are happening in. In the people in the personal life, um, that she's talking to, I mean about um. What does, um, what, what kind, what kind of job, um, uh, he's into or, um, the city that he lives in and, uh, um, may measure events in the city in those days, um. I think, uh, it's uh, it's about all the news, what's happening now in the in the. In that person life and, uh, so, uh, like a, like a normal conversation with other people about uh what kind of um. Uh, news that reads in, uh, in the city in environment that, uh, the person lives, uh, into.
  [05] Well, I think it should be. Just able to talk and to understand what you're saying. Well, to respond in the, in the right way, so speaking of what you're talking about and maybe the answer is what. Is right because sometimes it can, it can happen that the the the companion didn't understand what, what I may say. Uh what I've seen, so. Just to make the the conversation nicer and more enjoyable.
  [06] Uh, I think that the most important capabilities that uh an ideal virtual dealing companion must have. Are like a good response time for sure. Maybe a little bit of uh understanding more uh in real time. Uh, and maybe a little bit more context. Also, as I said, you know that responses, uh, he need the, uh, internet connection and some tools that make me. Uh, feel it useful.
  [07] Um, again, it's, uh, from my point of view, it's hard to, uh, find a specific characteristic because I don't, uh, feel the need to use it, but I would say, uh, probably the sense of humor would be the most important stuff. I also think it's the hardest stuff to, um, manage to obtain because it's, it has to be really sophisticated and depends on the individual, so, um, I think it's hard to replicate, uh, humor. Uh, or create it, um, but that will be the most useful part because if you, um, otherwise it can get boring or, uh, it can feel a little distant, so it can, it can even be, um. Not a detrimental to the situation, or, but if it's, if it's able to laugh and give a laugh, then it's a, it's a, it's better.
  [08] Surely it has to be responsive, active, and, uh. Always, uh, interested in what you're saying or doing because, uh, uh, otherwise, uh, it's not so, uh, useful, um, as a companion. So I think it should be very Uh, attentive, very focused on what, uh, he's doing. It is doing.
  [09] I think it should be as much as humanlike it can, so it has to be kind, um. It has to have, it has to show interest. Um, during the chat and uh. I don't know, it has to be warming. It, it doesn't have to feel mechanic, so. The more humanlike it can be, the better.
  [10] I would say like. But so many things, I mean, like someone I want to talk maybe to movies, so I don't I want to talk maybe of games, anything else, even of history or even internet, even on YouTube or maybe draws animations, I would say that there are some things that. Show me a good idea. I would say of course it is. Would be good.
  [11] I think that they could, they could have some more um an active part. I mean, so you can ask something or even talk about, tell something about itself, even if I know that's, it's an artificial character, so it's something that doesn't exist, but it would be nice if it can have, can have a story behind. Uh, so, even if it's just a story, if it's not real, but uh, people it's interesting to know something about who he's talking to.
  [12] Uh, the most important capabilities, I think there should be empathy and, uh, the, the virtual virtual uh companion should, uh, uh, should be interested in what you're saying and trying to expand what you're saying and maybe uh. Using the knowledge to, to, to, to say something more on about what are you, are you talking to and maybe some questions about yourself or what have you done or what you like and things like that. I think that, yeah, the, the, the thing that has to be responsive and ask questions or expand on those questions.
  [13] I think a virtual character should be very flexible, should manage many topics, many, uh, should, should manage them very deeply, profoundly, and um should be able to adapt to different situations. At least. I would be. Pro
  [14] I believe it should have the ability to adapt to your questions, respond to them accordingly. Um, I would like it also to have a bit of a personality. Um, I do not know if this is possible, but maybe, uh, for it to be able to give, uh, personal preference. For example, I talked About movies, but the character could not say what movie was his or her, or in my case, her favorite. So, I do not say necessarily to give an opinion, but maybe to make it feel more personal, give the character an ability to express somewhat of a preference for these neutral things.
  [15] I think that an avatar that having lunch with you has to lunch, has to have lunch. Itself. So it could, it should, it, it is better than when I have my lunch. Also the avatar has his, so it is more real that we can eat together while speaking and and doing conversations.

==================================================

 What topics should it talk about?

--- GRUPPO: PERSONALIZZATO (N=16) ---
  [01] No, I really like the, the questions because there was like, um, personal questions, uh, so I got to talk, uh, a bit about what I feel and what I felt the, the occasions they, they, they asked me about. And uh The questions were good. Maybe no, no, they were good. I, I enjoyed them.
  [02] It should be able to talk about everything, every topics, because it is to be able to talk about like of lazy things of, of everyday like routines and something, uh, but also like serious topics because for those who want to talk about it like I asked, I asked it like, um, political topic. And it doesn't. He didn't want to respond to me, so he should be able to talk about that.
  [03] I don't think there are certain topics that we should talk about. As I've said before, I think it should be able to understand the interests of the person it's talking to, and from there, Understand what to talk about because everyone's different, so I think. There's, there aren't certain specific topics that we should talk about. Um,
  [04] Um, I think it could be useful to have a sort of plethora of common topics to expand on. Um, I think people tend to talk about certain things mostly in this moment, so maybe. I don't know, a number of common topics just to be able to keep a point and expand on it.
  [05] So, uh, as I was saying before, um, I believe that, um, well, topics, um, could range from, uh, I don't know, uh, simple, uh, simple, um. Um, Yeah, I wanna say a different word from top than topics, but yeah, simple topics to, uh, I don't know, huge existential questions, uh, that could actually be answered by, uh, the, the AI, you know, um, I think those are the kind of, uh, of arguments of, uh, yeah, of discussions I would have to with uh, with an AI.
  [06] It would be great if they started talking about um politics and more about um topics concerning, for example, healthcare, so, such as abortions, but at the same time, also the right of life and Uh, I, for example, I'm, um, specializing in the law field, so I would like to talk about some of um the most important topics and case studies that concern my type of study. That would be great because, you know, you have more topics to talk about and you will be able to simulate um a conversation with a normal person, but with uh an IE.
  [07] Um, maybe they, uh, have to try to talk, um, normally, like a normal human being. Uh, I think that, uh, the avatar has to be designed on the single person, so, uh, the avatar have to understand the topic, uh, um, the type of topic that the person like. And continues uh on that type of uh um topic. But I think that uh it uh have to be um individually um prescript, not uh universal. So every every person have to have the, a different type of a, avatar that uh have to talk about specific topic, a range of specific topic, but designed on the single person.
  [08] Uh, I think about, uh, the main topics like, um, uh, like music, like, uh, maybe politics, uh, um. Films, uh, everything, um, can be an interest for the, for the, for the speaker, um, and maybe something about, uh, his private life, but I, I think that can be achieved, uh, um, from many, many speaks with the, with the avatar.
  [09] I think a nice way to way to start the conversation is talking about what the person is eating, or maybe the way the food was prepared or bought. And uh maybe uh the conversation can go from there and touch, touch other. Topics. Um, like the place the person live in. Or maybe uh the culture. Of the. Place. Or maybe. And the. The routine, the daily routine. The person's having at the moment. And I don't know, everything actually.
  [10] Mm, I think everything. Obvious, uh, reading books, uh, TV series, uh, weather. Anything, work, gym. Something that. Oh, everything, uh, family, um. Feelings, uh, um, everything, small chart, nearly everything.
  [11] Well, the topics it should speak about, talk about, I think are the generic ones like movies, uh, nature, traveling, or sports, uh, so, uh, I think the um the topics should be, uh. Uh, those, um, which can help to have a, a good conversation and a longer conversation also interesting and, uh, so, uh, I think it should, uh, understand the, the topics, the, the person in front of the, of it, uh, is interested of and trying to, to steer the conversation in uh, in that, uh, direction. Uh, I also think it should, uh, speak about news because, uh, in this way, you, uh, also have companion but also you can, uh, be informed.
  [12] um Voor mij? um You should talk about uh simple things such as sport, hobby. uh voeden. Wat um uh important. T. X. Mm. uh. Dat is uh work uh or uh society.
  [13] It talked about the interest uh of uh the person who Uh, interact with He And uh Um, movies, um, museum. Um, uh, story. about um And hope beat.
  [14] Um, I don't know, I think it should be able to talk about uh. Large set of topic in order to. Be appealing to Whoever it's talking to so um. Yeah, I mean. I don't know. I, I don't think there are topics that are off limits, um, so I would say. The more the better.
  [15] It would be useful if the topics were Decided directly by the the person because everyone has different interests and different experiences to share. So having uh just someone to share these experiences with uh would be the, the best way to use this tool. Uh, it should be able to Just ask for sure, ask about how the day went, uh, their activities, their interests, and uh just it.
  [16] I think you should talk about everyday experiences, everyday situations, so that it can uh really have a conversation with the the human being and um also like have something such as um like an approach such as AI, so that whatever you you want to talk about, he is able, it is able to um. To to talk about it, like whatever topic you have in mind, uh, it should be able to um have the enough information to. Uh, have a conversation.

--- GRUPPO: STATICO (N=15) ---
  [01] Um, the Virtual companion should talk about, uh, uh, topics that may interest the, you know, the person that she's talking to, he's talking to, and, uh, you know, maybe the food that uh we are eating and uh other topics that may create a conversation. So the question that we Where, um, in the individual in the sim in the simulation were actually correct because it made me talk more about uh uh what she was asking.
  [02] From my perspective and also my uh interaction with the avatar, I would say that the topics uh can be um personal. And the and also can be personalised. For example, if a person lives near the sea, or in a specific um Time of the year, they, they can talk about the weather and also it's uh It it could be interesting if the author would have some sort of uh could answer some sort of uh questions also of. News or uh how's the weather that day or. Um, I'm thinking about what, uh, what the Italian would say, for example, I was my soccer, uh, team yesterday. I don't know what, what was the score of my soccer team and um that could be very interesting and that could be very useful for the Uh, upgrade of the Avatar.
  [03] Maybe it could talk about music or um um. university history or, uh, like, uh, news and what's happening in the world and all kind of, uh, topics, uh, uh, that, uh, to normal people could talk about, uh, during, uh, uh, lunch or a dinner.
  [04] As I said, um, I, I think 1st, 1st topics are the news. Uh, um, around the world and then, um, uh, going to, to know, um, where live, uh, the person that, uh, yeah, he's eating, um, to be more specific about what, uh, what is, what is living, where he's living, and, uh, um. Uh, know better about the news, uh, in the place the person lives in, and then, uh, um, also is, uh, interesting, um, talking about life, about, uh, uh, how do you feel, um, help people to express, uh, about, uh, how they feel.
  [05] Um, I think you should be able to talk about her mostly everything. So it's, uh, so it can be nice to talk with this companion about. Almost everything and I go. Maybe a different answers to what me. Um, to what people, normal people can give you, so. That's, that's what I think about.
  [06] The, I think that the most useful topics that a coach, uh, companion should, uh, Have the skill to talk about it. Uh, it's like, uh. Some, uh Very trustful, uh. And informative topics. That maybe as well can be helpful in the kitchen. And maybe some uh real-time news. So like uh if you want to. I know the news of all the days, you can ask it. And uh uh if you are interested in something, you can ask to do a research about it.
  [07] Um, I don't think the, um, topic of the conversation is too relevant. In general, I would say just get away from food. It can be a good starting point, but in general I would say that it's much more important how. Uh, how the avatar is, is perceived by the, uh, the human, uh, rather than the topic of the conversation. Uh, I think for a conversation to be useful, uh, it has to be stimulating on some levels. It has to, uh, let the, I don't know, human being express as best, um, uh, and so it's not really a matter of topic and. It can be, it, let's say that the most, uh, the more it varies, uh, and the more the, the broader is the conversa conversation, I think it's the best, the better.
  [08] What topics I think it, it should uh speak about uh everything because uh Otherwise you're nothing to talk about and uh maybe. Not um very personal things, but uh. You can talk about everything. It's not a, it's not a problem. If a person wants to be with another one. He, he needs to, to speak about everything, uh. Freely.
  [09] I would say that it has to understand, comprehend, and Keep on chatting about. Um, the topics chosen by the one who's talking and uh. I guess that. It would be slightly better if there is um. Some kind of preference for uh light topics in the end of it all it's just a chat during lunchtime, so. I think that light topics are better.
  [10] Like, I can say. Like maybe talk. I mean, some topics like maybe movies, like the movie Dragon Trainer, doing Jurassic Park, Godzilla, something like that. Games like Jurassic World Game or even Jurassic World, so I'm really like to try the dinosaur games. But show me this like topics to talk about.
  [11] It could be useful if she could have more topics, uh, such as friendship, uh, um, love. History, um, storytelling in general, not something concerning politics or war because I have very, um, not very, very nice talking about, I think if we go with stuff using, I, I think that it can be useful for people with, uh, time alone so it's not uh a good thing to talk about something that's worth.
  [12] I think there should be uh small talks, so I don't know like movies, TV, books, or maybe the weather, sometimes even some lightly politics topics, but I think it's better than personal stuff. Uh, but I, I, I, I understand if someone wants to talk about personal stuff, but I don't know if a virtual character can, with your companion can answer to this, these kind of questions.
  [13] I think a virtual character should speak about um any kind of topic with a reasonable uh deep deepness depth because it should uh manage from academic things to casual things to sports to actuality so it has to be very, very flexible as I said before.
  [14] I think it, it would be nice for the character to be able to talk about any kind of topic. Of course, uh, it's good that this one was programmed to keep the conversation light, so as to avoid making the person feel bad about certain topics. It would be nice for it to be able to. Generally speak about any hobbies, um, or maybe even subjects, school subjects maybe too, because it could be even good to practice. In these cases.
  [15] I like cooking, so I'm very curious to find out new recipes, so an Avatar should talk about new recipes and ingredients and typical plates of other countries in the world. So something more interesting than simply say, I put tomato and mozzarella cheese on top of my pizza's. Gazzetta.

==================================================

What are the potential disadvantages of such companions?

--- GRUPPO: PERSONALIZZATO (N=16) ---
  [01] I cannot think about disadvantages, maybe. Maybe uh someone that's that understand that it it is really not a real person. Uh, could be like frustrated about or annoyed about the fact that it is, uh, it is in fact a virtual companion, and, uh, I don't know, I, I, I always feel that that a real person is, is obviously better.
  [02] I think that uh if the experience is too realistic some people might prefer this. Experience to um interaction to seeking interaction with real people, but if it's not designed well. Probably it might um worsen the people's feelings, feelings of loneliness or worsen their relationship with food.
  [03] I'm no expert, but that's like, the only concern I would have is sharing information that could be sensitive information uh to Like a mutual companion, so that means maybe there's the potential of being spied, hurt, and stuff, so that's the only concern that that comes to mind. I didn't even mentioned that.
  [04] I think potentially it could be counterproductive in some ways. Uh, I mean, the possibility to have someone to talk to without a real person being there could, uh, bring some people that tend to isolate to do that even more so because they already have someone to talk with, that's not a real person. So in that way, I think it could have disadvantages, surely.
  [05] So I think that one of the potential disadvantage that AI could be could have it on uh, on people is, as I was saying in the previous videos. Um, if someone is feeling left out, well, it could only exacerbates, I think it, yeah, the, the, the, the situation, you know, and, uh, maybe. With the right amounts of, uh, you know, um. Of, uh, companionship, you can say, uh, of this AI with this kind of people, uh, it could be useful, but it, I think it's also, it also has to be, um. You know, controlled by some standards because otherwise you could have only negative, uh, um. Um, impacts on the life of these of these, yeah, of these persons, you know, and, um. Yeah. Watch out.
  [06] Potential disadvantages could be related to the abuse of this kind of companions because it will not um make sure that people start having some conversations with normal people and using too much of the IE can stop making sure this happens. It's so firma. It's
  [07] As I said before, no, sorry, um, as I said before, the, um, the disadvantage could be in some pathological, uh, uh, situation like I said, the, the, the, the social isolation, uh, uh, in, in like Ikikomori or something like that. Uh, this type of iteration could, uh, uh, could, uh, um, make worse the situation, so we have to be really aware about this, uh, and, uh, to control the situation. Because yes this could be a a very good um. Help for people that suffer about loneliness but not for people that search the loneliness and the social isolation because in this type of situation. It's not uh useful. Another disadvantages disadvantages could be the uh presence of uh mm. Uh, the develop of social isolation about these people that can, uh, um. Um, find relief in this type of, uh, interaction and lose the ability to have uh. Social social interaction outside this virtual world, so. Yes. Like, uh, like all the thing, like, uh, all the internet, like all the, um, personal computers, smartphone, and, uh, whatsoever, they have advantage and disadvantage. So we have to
  [08] Maybe, uh, a colder response from the, from the avatar and not being able to, um, to talk about private things, uh, about mm, human, uh, human beings, for example, human relations, uh, I, I think it, it, mm, it would be a problem for the, for the avatar to have some, something like a human touch. I don't know how to, to describe it.
  [09] I don't think there are any real disadvantages, uh. I think, uh, limits of the. The thing I tried was the. Language. That is not the. Uh, spoke. By everyone, uh, so. Many people can't really have a real conversation with an avatar. And Uh. I don't know. I, I don't think there is. Much.
  [10] Maybe that having uh some of these companions at home on the computer will make them go going just to them instead to real people if they have a problem. Like, uh, I don't know, I feel sick and I wanna talk to them instead of the doctor. I feel lonely and I keep talking just to them and not making new friends, things like this, maybe.
  [11] Well, I think there are potential disadvantages of uh such companions and uh the main one, I think it is that uh you would like it so much that you wouldn't uh need uh to have real conversation anymore, so. The, I think the main danger is that you will be, uh, you will find yourself, um, preferring to talk with the virtual companion instead of a, of a real person. And that's I think would would be would be very bad. Other disadvantages, um, well, maybe if, uh, if it doesn't work well, um. It could be, it could be a little bit irritating for the people in front of it. So I, I mean if if it's uh slow or it doesn't come up with interesting arguments.
  [12] Maybe I think uh difficult um of the companion. uh will be should be um understand uh de The people uhm. um What really uh the person think uh at the moment.
  [13] Potential disadvantage of such companions are, I, for my experience in the, the language because it's very Difficult to um Uh, understand. The English, um, not for people, for Italian people, because, uh, other nations, uh, are Uh, very useful to, uh, Speak and understand because they are um. Um, there are, uh, movies on, uh, Original language. We, we in Italian translate. Uh, films, and that, and that is not good.
  [14] Um, so I, I don't know. I think that the disadvantages could be. Kind of similar to the so-called AI psychosis, so people that spent a lot of time. And um, Kind of in an echo chamber, like receiving the same sort of information and being fed on their delusion. I think that for people that are already experiencing some kind of delusion that could be harmful, but actually, I didn't find the avatar to be um. Mm. That way at all, so. It wasn't like always agreeing with what I was saying or stuff like that, so. Mm, I don't think it's a risk for this, this type of avatar.
  [15] I think the most important disadvantage or the most important threat about these companions would be the risk of Preferring technological company to human company, uh, especially for young people, it could lead to a state of isolation and um. I don't know, just escape the everyday life, which for an adult people it may be more difficult because an adult has more resources while a younger person can easily be misled into thinking that this relationship is somewhat a friendship.
  [16] Maybe that if you have no one to talk to, uh if you're like lonely uh or uh just um find it difficult to um meet people and maybe start a relationship with them, uh having uh such a companion uh would maybe uh discourage um. Searching for uh new friends, for example, searching for human relations that are uh definitely um more important than uh any kinds of virtual uh relationship, um, so I think that's something we have to really be careful not to uh end up with.

--- GRUPPO: STATICO (N=15) ---
  [01] Uh, well, if there are maybe an overuse of virtual companions, it may create a dissociation from the actual, you know, word and the actual, um, people to dine with, but I think we're still very far off from the overuse of virtual intelligence. And so the disadvantages at the moment, uh, I don't think there are very much uh um worrying.
  [02] Um, For the potential disadvantages, uh, I would say from a social point of view that this kind of uh projects uh can isolate and uh um make the uh person or the People that are using this uh components, um. To not search any more human interactions that are the most important things in a person's life. And but. Again, I think it's uh. That's my only disadvantage that that I can think of and uh. But maybe they they can be used some kind of a timer. Uh jacket or you can only use the avatar while uh. Eating that could be uh I think important for trying to not fall in this uh. Pattern
  [03] I think the potential disadvantages of such companions, are that, um, uh, you could feel, uh, uh, a bit, uh, like dissociated from the conversation, and it could feel a bit, uh, mm, unnatural. Uh, but, uh, I think it can be like uh improved to feel, uh, more realistic.
  [04] And learn about, uh, um, give the proper space, uh, to the other, uh, with an avatar that is always waiting for you and um. Wants, uh, uh, wants to give you a companion, um, there is no problem, but, uh, with a real person with real people, uh, you have to learn, uh, uh, when to talk, when, uh, someone, uh, needs peace and um. Create empathy. Uh, I don't think you can, uh, empathize with a, with an avatar. So, uh, for a short period, maybe, uh, he can, he can help an avatar can help in some ways, but, um, uh, can, um, make you, uh. Make you lose the sensibility to talk with real people.
  [05] Probably the disadvantages would be that uh being um. And I, uh. It may, maybe it doesn't know. Everything about the the conversation you're having and maybe they should look online for the answer and it's not probably the the best. Uh, the best to have maybe an opinion, uh, so. It's probably the the the major disadvantage is that it's something that prayer. Uh, I, I don't have the word I'm sorry.
  [06] I think that's the most problematic things about um uh disadvantages of um. A virtual companion, it's like that, uh, there is a lot of sensi uh sensible people that can um substitute the real people with the virtual character, character. Also, uh, Maybe all of the, uh, all of. Those people Can, uh, be mentally ill and no one will know cause. They are locked in with a companion.
  [07] Uh, I think it really depends on how much, uh, society understands and, um, embrace this kind of, uh, instruments because, um, there, there's of course the obvious danger of detachment from, uh, uh, human society and interactions, but again, once, if we understand it as a, as an instrument and how to properly use it, uh, it can be really beneficial for, for a person. Um, other, other than that, I can only think of, I don't know, maybe, uh, looking too much at the, seeing too much in front of a screen, uh, but that's, that's the main, the main issue, of course, is, uh, uh, the interaction, uh, the, the lack of inter, the, the possible lack of interaction with a human being that can, uh, Come from talking with the talking too much or too frequently or or just getting used to talk only to a. Um, to an assistant, to a virtual assistant.
  [08] Uh, potential disadvantage could be, uh, maybe if someone, uh, starts to speak only with the avatar and becomes, uh, uh. Sort of like, um, dependent, I don't know uh how to say it, but uh. Maybe it starts to be used a lot to talk about with the avatar and then uh it stops to have the will to speak with other person, real person.
  [09] I can't see proper disadvantages, I guess that. Maybe going on um. After a massive usage of, um, these virtual characters, there can be, mm. A preference, maybe for virtual characters instead of. Humans, human companion. I don't know.
  [10] Johnson disadvantages are like, maybe the refrigerator or like. Sometimes forget what you're talking about. I mean, like, you're talking so much, but then she like doesn't know what you're talking about, what I was talking about earlier. It would be such a disadvantageous for someone. So I think that this should be a little bit fixed for companies for such companies.
  [11] Well, I think that, mm, only thing is if you were, uh, have just a relationship, a relationship, not a common in a common sense, but if you interact just with her, if you so, if you interact with the other people, I think that it can be not a good thing, not a good use of her and I.
  [12] Uh, the disadvantages they could be to to alienate yourself from, from other people, and you could rely only on companions and not, uh, on other people and not be in company with other people. I don't think that's. A real danger or maybe it is, but I think uh the companions should be for people who cannot see other people who cannot relate to other people for some reason, so they could be an an aid but not the. Our usual experience.
  [13] Oh. I think the disadvantages of these companions is that, uh, for example, is that, um. You may confuse reality with virtuality and maybe should could become more isolated from real people. Instead of searching real people to talk about these things and the things you want to talk about, so I think people should focus more on real relationships instead of virtual characters, but nonetheless, these characters are useful for uh lone people who have um. Difficulties with moving or who, who want to talk about very specific topics.
  [14] one disadvantage that I could see is for how I lived my experience that um maybe the character is not capable of immediately responding to your question, or maybe it still feels a bit too artificial, but I think that given the current technology, this is something that can be easily changed, um, making the character feel A bit more human. And of course, uh, it is good to use this character if you do not have the opportunity to interact with anybody, or maybe you're a shy person and talking to this character may give you a bit more of a social ability, but it would be good to remember, and maybe this is a good reason why it would be good not to make it to human, uh, that you can never replace a real human person talking with you. So, this is my opinion about this.
  [15] OK, the disadvantages of an avatar is that it's not a real human being and so nowadays we are always uh um um. Um We have a relationship with the computers, with the smartphones, with the non-real human beings, and so I think that if you want to live better, you have to have lunch with a real human being and That's what I think.

==================================================

Do you see any risks or dangers in using them?

--- GRUPPO: PERSONALIZZATO (N=16) ---
  [01] No, I don't see any risks or dangers, um. I, I, no, so I don't know, I imagine it like, um, used in a, a psychiatric, uh, hospital. And that's probably a little bit uh. You know, could be, could be dangerous in that way, in a way that like uh the. The, the patient don't feel um. Good about talking to, to, uh, uh, an artificial intelligence, so that's probably it. I don't know. I don't I can think about something else.
  [02] Yes, like, um, as I, as I was saying, if, mm, it's too mm. Too realistic. Um, probably the. Some people that are too lonely. Um, might prefer this to interacting with real people and but. Probably they need to be careful because if it's not designed well, the Uh The avatar, it could be. Um, like a worse experience with uh, for the, for their relationship with food.
  [03] I personally don't. But I'm aware that there could be like the same dangers and risks that you have when you use um Google Home or Siri or Alexa and stuff, so I see them the same level. So nothing more than that. I don't use those devices either, so, yeah.
  [04] I think dangers and disadvantages are on the same level. I mean, it could encourage isolation and keep people from speaking to real people just because they have, they already have someone to talk to, uh, virtually, um, but again, I only see that as a danger or as a. Um issue mostly, I think.
  [05] Um, well, risks and dangers. I don't think we have them right now because, yeah, it's still, uh, it's still too early, I think, but when, um. When it's gonna, when when the AI is gonna be, you know? More. More real, maybe, maybe, uh, then, uh, you'll have to find a, we'll have to find a, a way to, uh, understand which, uh, which risks and dangers, um, I, um. Can be caused by it, you know, and um. Yeah, we should only be aware and um. Try to not limit ourselves to, uh, thinking, OK, the AI will do it for me and uh, you know, try to, to do it ourselves and then maybe getting help from it. And I think I see this, uh, companion as a possible, possible, um, um. A possible AI, uh, feature that could, um. That could help a lot of us, yeah. Yep.
  [06] Uh, the risks or dangers may concern the fact that this type of, uh, companions may have too many information about you, and, um, it is not pretty much safe as it results, um, from, you know, some of the things you can, you know, see on the internet. So it might be uh something that worries me, uh, but, you know. At the moment, I don't really think about any type of dangers or risks that may concern this kind of machines.
  [07] I believe that uh uh the risk of or or dangers are um. Um, are only the social isolation. And the losing of capability of talk with the human with person. Because when you talk with an avatar you're not able to have. A discussion you only talk and you uh answer some question about topics that you like uh and uh in the mm in the moment when you talk uh uh with an avatar you will not have some uh mm. some fight. Maybe not the fighter, like. Fighting with with another people, but you know. It's, it's different to talk with a human being. Uh, so maybe this, uh, uh, can be a problem. Uh, in the social, uh, part of a person.
  [08] Uh, maybe the risk can be to. Mm, to feel more alone than, than you can be normally, um, because, um, probably is not the same thing as, uh, having human relations. And um maybe this can be the the biggest issue of the thing.
  [09] I don't think there are. Any risks or dangers about it as long as the. People using This uh. Technology, uh, do have. Other ways to socialize and be around real people, uh. So I don't think there are.
  [10] Yeah, the same things that I said before, that maybe they will tend to stay home and asking them for advice and uh miss all the parts, I mean, all the human part, the acts, kisses, all this stuff, they cannot give it to you. And maybe if they have a problem, they are gonna go to them to solve it instead of real people who can actually fix it, so. Yeah, it's.
  [11] So I don't think uh it could be um it would represent a a risk or danger, but I think that um uh people who uses them should be um um aware that they are of course not real people uh and uh to so uh to don't prefer their companion to to to to that from uh from real uh real people. Uh, so yeah, this is the, the, the main risk I find, uh, which could happen is to actually, uh, prefer a virtual companion instead of a, of a real one. Also, if it is so, um, another risk I, I could think about is that if it would become so um entertaining to, to stay too much time talking with it. Also, this one I think could be, could be um a danger.
  [12] OK, voor me um. en uh. And it is so dangerous, but the only one maybe uh should be the animation um to. uh voor de uh excessive use um electronic devices.
  [13] The the unique danger um using them, I think um it is um for, Young people that are. um. um. Sì. Mhm non lo so che non escono gli H- com'è in Giappone ci si chiamano Hakimi Mori là com'è che rimangono chiusi nelle loro stanze e quindi potrebbe essere un un danno. um Il non uscire.
  [14] Um, yeah, as I, as I said before, I, I do think that there may be some risk, some risks, especially for people that are already in a fragile state of mind, but I don't think that's the majority of people and. I also think that this could be like it's not a necessity, it could easily be. Corrected, so not really at the.
  [15] The main danger would be the risk of isolating, of stopping maybe seeing friends or family if you form a strong bond with these companions, this would cause An escape from the real life, the human companions, and it would, it would lead the person to isolate and just interacting with technology and not with real human beings.
  [16] Yes, like any technology tool, you have to be careful of the use that you make with it, um, for example, in this specific case, you could end up being emotionally dependent on the the virtual character, which obviously it's not fine for. Um, anyone's mental health, so you have to be uh careful about that, for example, but also like, um, in the privacy field, it could be dangerous, um, people could use it against you and so on, it could, um, it could give a bad advice if it's not instructed well, so there are definitely some risks and um yes.

--- GRUPPO: STATICO (N=15) ---
  [01] The risks of um uh visual companions and maybe the overuse of it, so the uh connection with a visual companion then may cause the dissociation from the actual living people and uh so yeah, the overuse of it and the normalization of eating with a virtual companion and not real people.
  [02] Yeah, I see some risks and dangers because as I said earlier, um, The main problem with also the artificial intelligence and um the technology in general is to uh is that it tends to isolate people. And maybe this add some sort of frus frustration and uh uh also it can lead to depression or sadness. And uh, but that's the whole point that the technology uh wants to avoid. But yeah, it's like um. According with to faces, uh, if sometimes it can help or it can do a lot of um. A bed and um. Yeah, the risk, risks, I would say is that it tends to isolate people.
  [03] In the short term, um, I don't see any risks or dangers in using them. But maybe for some kind of uh like particularly. Fragile people or personalities, it could be. A bit, uh, alienating because uh maybe they can develop some, uh, I don't know, maybe feelings or uh mm I don't know, yes, feelings for, uh, the artificial intelligence for the. OK. dining companion. Uh, and, uh, it could be a bit strange, but just for, uh, some particular kind of people, I think.
  [04] Yeah. Loss of um of contact to to reality, uh, it's not uh it's not real, it's not, uh, not real people, it's not someone that actually you can connect to, uh, because there is no connection in the other ways, um, uh, there's. A, a real soul, um, uh, to connect with, um, so I think this is the risk to, um, don't to, to lose the, the, the capacity to empathize, um. Or don't learn it, um. He's uh. It's um. I don't know it's it's dangerous, but uh it's not uh meaningful.
  [05] Um, no, I don't think there would be. And it causes danger in using them. I mean, they, they can just be maybe good for your uh. For your companion, they, they probably don't have any, any kind of risk or dangers. For what, for what I believe. They, they seem slow. Like a right alternative to being alone at lunch.
  [06] Uh, I think that one of the major risks or, or, or danger in using a virtual companion. Would be maybe. Uh, have not, uh, a very good trust, uh, trustness source. So you rely only on your companion for all the information you need and all the things that you need to do. And this usually isolate you and also you don't have. Uh, search for source goes uh. Um, like virtual companion are not perfect and can give you false information as well.
  [07] Again, the risk is, uh, detaching and, um, feeling alienated from our society, from our human society, uh, and it's a, mm, possible risk and it's, it's a very real, um. Possible risk, it's a real possibility that we can, um, get to, um, but. I, I think it's a matter of how society again, uh, relates with this kind of, uh, instruments and how it's, how it's, um. Manages them and how it properly informs people, uh, about the use of such instruments.
  [08] As I said before, maybe I. I use uh an exaggerated use of of the avatar can be uh dangerous for. The perception of uh sociality of the person who is speaking with the avatar. But um for this I, I think, uh, you can put some uh limits to the avatar so that the person knows that maybe you have only 30 minutes to talk with it and, and then stop so you don't get uh to use uh about it.
  [09] Not in the near future, I think that maybe, um. As I was talking in the previous question, there uh may be the risk of a preference. In the company of virtual characters instead of humans, but it's something quite dystopical and also. Really, really far in the future, so I don't think that there are many issues or dangers in using virtual characters.
  [10] I would say more dress like sometimes um I talk about something, even talking or even like start talking about something that she didn't ask her. Or even start doing other things. And then for risks, dangers, I don't see anything. Well, I mean, for now, I don't see anything more dangerous. So, I see there are some little risk in front of dangers.
  [11] Uh, can be dangerous if you use it just for the main purpose that is the, uh, to be not, to not feel alone, to have someone to talk to. But, uh, as I said, first, if you have just her as a person to talk to, it can be, um, an isolation as well. So if I'm worse now with a new person.
  [12] The risks are that people alienate themselves from the world and start to connect only uh through this virtual companion and to, to remove themselves from the company of other humans and not companions so I think that's, that could be a risk and but I think um if I think it's a risk that's dangerous that. And for very few people. I don't think that could be a really danger.
  [13] As I said before, the, the risks, the risks about using virtual characters are, for example, that you could isolate from reality or become more lone, lone, and you could prefer, um, digital world instead of real world. And Maybe you could, um, yes, isolate more. So it's not, it's not all. I mean it's, it's fine, but you should be careful about using them.
  [14] I honestly do not see any risk in using this kind of technology unless it were to become too human-like. But as far as it is right now, I still can understand that there is a difference between this character and a real human being. And not to mention that, of course, if there is a limitation to the type of conversations it can have to the kind of assertivity that the character can give you, it can still be good and we could. Um, try not to fall into some dangerous territory, right? Because if it were to be made too assertive, then maybe the character would, um, show being OK with certain topics or certain, certain positions that are too strong. So, it would be good to, mm, make this. These characters, so as they, they do not agree, uh, talking about certain topics or, um, giving positive opinions to something, to some opinion which is not positive in itself, like maybe about racism or discrimination of any sorts.
  [15] No, I think that there are no risks or dangers in using avatars, just a little bit, of course, during the, during your days, you have to interact with the human beings, with colleagues, with friends, with family people, and then if sometimes you want to have lunch with an avatar, you have to do it.

  DOMANDA: Q34_Video_Transcript
==================================================

How did the last 30 minutes affect your sense of connection to others?

--- GRUPPO: PERSONALIZZATO (N=16) ---
  [01] Um, it didn't really affect, I think, maybe. I understood that I enjoy talking while while. You know, having a meal. And probably I understood that I, I'm someone who likes to, uh, not only to talk about myself but also, you know, mm, to understand something about. The, the people I'm talking to, so probably. That's it, so I, I like to, to ask people something to know what other people feel, what, what other people think.
  [02] Um, I don't think that affected me so much because it was, um, uh, like a, a short interaction with the, with the avatar, but I think that if it's too long, it could be like. But it could be bad for some aspects that I took before. And, but I'm. I, I think that I'm connected to the to others like I was before.
  [03] Not that much, although I appreciated a little bit more the human connections I have. Because I don't know, I. I imagine myself with no one to talk to and being. Forced to talk to a virtual device. It, it, it would be kind of depressing for me to think that, so I'm more grateful about the human connections I have.
  [04] I don't think it really altered my sense of connection to others. I don't think I have a connection to A virtual being. I don't think I had a real connection with her. But she is of company, so, I think it is useful in that sense. I don't think it's going to alter your connection to others, just talking with her for 10 minutes.
  [05] So I actually don't really feel, um, affected by, uh, well, the last 30 minutes of my life. I just believe that, uh, it's, um, a real nice, um. Way of, uh, having an AI, you know, uh, companion to your meals. It's something that could be, uh, useful, as I was saying before, and, uh, I don't really feel, um, better or worse, you know, uh. But I feel, uh, well, grateful that people study these kind of things, you know, kind of, because I can't really study them, so awesome.
  [06] It did not affect me negatively. I mean, I liked, you know, eating and talking to someone, and, you know, it was a really great experience, and I would recommend doing it. As far as I'm concerned, everything went fine. And apart from some um problems with the, uh, you know, talking and sometimes. dealing with the graphic, but I think that it's a great, a great experience that I would recommend to anybody. Um, it did not affect me negatively when it comes to having conversations with other people. Um, I think, and I still think that it's a great way um to help those who are in need of companions and in need of someone to talk to when they don't have nobody by their sides.
  [07] Uh, in the last 30 minutes, uh, I didn't have a factor on my sense of connection to the others, but I think that, uh, if some person, uh, um. We use to match this type of interaction with a virtual avatar it can affect the connection to the others. But. It, as I said before, The connect the the sense of connection to the other is strictly connected to um the amount of use of this uh situation and uh is connected to the basal situation of a person so it's not strictly connected with the avatar but is I think that is connected to the whole situation of a person so is I think that. The risk is the social isolation, yes, but. It's not because of the Avatar but it's because there is a substract. Um, of social isolation in the person, not only by the avatar, the, the reason. That, that is not only the out of the problem, but all the Uh, situation of about divers.
  [08] Uh, I don't really know what what can be the effect against the connection with with others. Um, maybe it can make me feel a little more, uh, lonely. I don't know. Um, it's, uh, it's funny to think about it in perspective of um technological advancement, but, uh, for human purpose, uh, I, I don't know. I don't think I liked it so much.
  [09] I think it was good for my sense of connection to others, because, uh. My mind was set on the conversation. I was not thinking about something else, and uh so it was a good way to be present and to focus on the other person, uh. So it was a nice. Nice moment to. Uh, deepen my sense of connection to others.
  [10] I think it was fine, as no, as long as you use it just to have company in some moments of your life, like you know you're gonna be alone. Because you cannot have constantly someone to talk to. I mean, sometimes it, it's nice to be alone, but I mean, using it doesn't change the fact that I'm going having dinner or lunch with a friend instead of the, instead of it, or that I'm gonna use it on the other side when I feel lonely. I wanna just talk to someone and maybe not everybody is available. We want this one or not yeah.
  [11] Well, these last 30 minutes, I don't think they affected my sense of connection to others, but uh I think they made me, um, think about, uh, about connection. I mean, uh, speaking with a, with a virtual companion was, uh, a little bit strange but also interesting because, um. In some parts it uh, it was talking about uh topics I'm interested to, so I was a little bit uh. I don't know, also curios, but uh, also, um, it, it was also awkward. In some parts and um. I think it made me or. Appreciate the the companion because and the connection with others because uh uh I think I saw the. How important it is to to have a a a real conversation.
  [12] Oh um ai. E. uh Maar probably um. uh uh. Iva. uh last uh important part of the human uh connection in relation. relationship with de The human part of the others.
  [13] Now, I see that um Progress in uh In, uh, in information technology, and, uh, in, uh, science. are very, very fast and uh I think the progress is uh a beautiful uh Occasion for the, for best. Word.
  [14] Yeah, so I don't think the last 30 minutes affected my sense of connection to others at all, but it's also true that I was in a Like social situation beforehand, I was strolling with a friend and talking to him and I spent the last couple of hours interacting with one of my students, so mm I wasn't feeling disconnected. Maybe if I, if I had, it would be different, um, I don't know. I feel a bit. Mm. More self-conscious in a way. So that's all.
  [15] Um, this experience helped me understand how important having someone to dine with is and also that if someone does not have this possibility. Uh, there are some alternatives that can and should be, uh, studied and made in order to allow even uh the the people who are not, uh, who, who haven't got uh close friends or family to uh having someone who asks about their day and uh That can bring some companionship.
  [16] Um, it definitely made me appreciate all the times that I had to that I had some meal with, um, my family with my friends, so human interactions while eating, I think it they're better than having, um, a virtual interaction with a with a computer, but uh it's definitely something really interesting to work on and to. You know, like, study more and more and uh search other ways of using technology um to help, um, the everyday activities that we have to to do and maybe, um, computers could do. Instead of us.

--- GRUPPO: STATICO (N=15) ---
  [01] Um, my connection with others wasn't very affected, and, uh, I liked the companion and the company she, she, she gave me, uh, but I didn't, didn't make me, uh, feel weird towards actual people and uh connection with others, I think it just stayed the same.
  [02] Um, given that I am a very sociable person, I usually eat with the family or friends, uh, almost every day. And this uh the sense of connection that I have towards others now, it's uh is that I, I want to do more, more um eating together, spending time together. Things like that. But on the other side, it's very interesting how how this project can be developed and how it can be useful for other people that are not as lucky as me.
  [03] In the last 30 minutes, um, I think, um, that, um, I'm feeling, um, as I was talking to a real person, almost like I was talking to a real person, so I feel kind of connected to others and, uh, willing to have, uh, conversations. I know. No but I'm just, uh.
  [04] Actually, actually, I feel a lot um. More into other in in other people because um this experience um make me think of uh how it's important to um uh. Getting connection, uh, I mean emotionally, I mean, uh, uh, personally with the others and it's something that I, uh, didn't get with this, um, exercise, uh, with the avatar, so, um. Now I feel that I would like to talk to a real person.
  [05] Uh, those started last minutes, uh, probably will affect my. My connection, the sense of connection with others in some way where. I will enjoy more having conversation with with other people because usually I enjoy it but not that much. I mean sometimes I try to avoid. Being talkative with uh other people because I just don't want to talk sometime. But maybe by. Having more shot it, it would be nice also for me.
  [06] Uh, Talking with a with a companion makes me. Feel maybe a little ashamed but also understand more that uh talk to people, it's very different from talk with uh. Uh, with a companion. Of course. So maybe LLMs use uh, uh, a language that it's strongly artificial. And also, uh, it's uh an experience that it's halfway to talking with the computer and halfway to talking with a stranger that it's your first time to talk about with it.
  [07] I think there is still a distance between human interaction and the interaction I just said, so I. Um, I, I don't feel to, um, draw this parallelism between human and, um. Let's say, a virtual assistant, um, because it's still different and it still serves in mm, my, let's say, uh, sociality, my, uh, my social life different purposes, uh, even though I interacted only in a very, very, very small, uh, percentage of time just this occasion, uh, but still, I, I think that if, even if I, um. Introduce this, this virtual assistant in my life. I would still use it for very different reasons and I would still feel I, I need uh human interaction on some levels, um. So I don't, I don't, I don't know if it will change the way I see the interaction with other people. I think it will change more the way I, uh, feel about or express about myself and how I feel about my thoughts. Let's say, let's put it this way.
  [08] Not much really. I think uh I still prefer to talk about with the, with real people but um I, I, I think this is a, an, an important thing uh for maybe the people who don't have someone to talk to. So uh Uh, I feel more connected to those people, uh. Because I, I'm. I understood what um. Eating with an avatar could, could mean, so it's something uh very. Very chill chilling for some. Some people
  [09] I don't think that there have been major differences, um, it was uh. Way better than I expected, to be honest. It was like chatting. Almost with, um, I wouldn't say a friend, but with someone, it's like the those kind of small talks that anyone has been going through, so. I think that, um, it felt, uh, I felt the difference when I switched over with talking with a friend of mine, but, uh, I thought that it would have been uh way bigger of a difference.
  [10] Because if we're talking like about may have things to say, if we talk about some national borders, it's another trip. Because when you start to talk about your character saying this, then you go on, go on, go on. And you prefer to talk to this retractor and sometimes you will maybe not talk so much to your friends. Or even other's people with your mom and dad same.
  [11] I think, after trying to talk with an I, I think that if you have the possibility to talk with a human person is always the best option. But, um, I know that sometimes it's not possible, so it's a, a good alternative. And um, So, not, not so, not so bad things if you don't have any other possibility to talk with someone. But just use it well.
  [12] I don't think the last 30 minutes affected my sense of connection to the others. I'd like this experiment to talk to a virtual companion, and I think that it's something that can improve your meals or your everyday life when you're alone, but, uh, I didn't think that affected my sense of connection to the others. It was just, uh. I think that I did and maybe the repetitive use of this kind of interaction can affect the sense of connection to the others, but it didn't for me.
  [13] Um, honestly, I think, um, these minutes I spent with the avatar, uh, make me. Made me feel enthusiastic about uh practicing English practicing about um new finding new experiences, but. And, and it also made me more open to talking with, with, uh, real people as well.
  [14] I think these 30 minutes were positively affected. I'm For how I live the experience with this character, I do not think that it hindered or it made me lose the connection, the desire to connect with other people, but rather, I wish to talk to people more right now.
